### ⚡ Tech Stack (a.k.a My Arsenal)  

Whenever I go tech mode, I pick up:  

🟨 **JavaScript** → Because every dev’s love–hate relationship  
⚛️ **React** → For snappy UIs and lots of props drilling (oops)  
🎨 **CSS** → To fight divs until they are centered  
🌊 **Tailwind** → Styling with speed (and sometimes chaos)  
🌿 **MongoDB** → Where my data chills in documents  
🟢 **Node.js** + **Express** → My backend ninjas, silently running the show

### 🤹 Fun Facts
- 🔧 “Works on my machine” is my default QA strategy.  
- 🐛 I don’t make bugs… I create **undocumented features**.  
- 🥤 Runs on coffee + late-night debugging sessions.
